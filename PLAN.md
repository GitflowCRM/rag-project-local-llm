## Qdrant Use Case Implementation Plan for Shopify Vendor Assistant

### 🧱 Step 1: Preprocessing & Embedding User Behavior

#### 🎯 Goal:

Convert raw PostHog user event streams into structured summaries and embeddings for fast retrieval and analysis.

#### 🔧 Implementation Steps:

1. **Ingest Events from PostHog:**

   * Stream raw event logs via PostHog webhooks or batch API.
   * Structure events per user-session (or per user).

2. **Preprocess with LLM (Summarizer Prompt):**

   * Extract metadata: device, geo, app version, event counts, cart status, etc.
   * Generate 2 outputs:

     * **Structured Metadata (JSON)**
     * **Behavioral Summary (Text)**

3. **Embed Summary:**

   * Use an embedding model (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small`, `BGE-Small`, `InstructorXL`).
   * Store embedding + metadata in Qdrant.

4. **Schema Suggestion:**

```ts
{
  id: "person_id",
  vector: [embedding],
  payload: {
    summary: "User explored checkout but didn’t complete",
    cartActivity: "abandoned",
    userType: "First-time User",
    vendorId: "gid://shopify/Shop/XXXX",
    emailVerified: false,
    city: "Dubai",
    sessionFrequency: "2 sessions in 24h",
    eventCount: 27,
    lastActivityAt: "2025-06-20T11:00:00Z",
    ... // more
  }
}
```

### 🔍 Step 2: Similarity Search

#### 🎯 Goal:

Allow questions like: *“Find users who behave like…”* or *“Users likely to convert based on XYZ traits.”*

#### 🧠 How:

* Query with a user’s summary embedding or crafted question embedding.
* Rank by cosine similarity.

#### 🔧 Implementation:

```ts
qdrantClient.search(
  collection: 'user_profiles',
  vector: embed(query),
  limit: 10
)
```

Add filtering by `vendorId` to isolate per merchant.

---

### ⚙️ Step 3: Hybrid Filtered Search

#### 🎯 Goal:

Support queries like: *“Find users in UAE who added to cart and opened the app more than 3 times.”*

#### 🔧 Implementation:

```ts
qdrantClient.search({
  vector: embed("Find cart users in UAE"),
  filter: {
    must: [
      { key: "cartActivity", match: { value: "added" } },
      { key: "country", match: { value: "United Arab Emirates" } },
      { key: "sessionFrequency", range: { gte: 3 } }
    ]
  }
})
```

---

### 📋 Step 4: RAG Re-Ranking

#### 🎯 Goal:

Improve result quality by:

* Searching broadly via embedding
* Refining using LLM or rules

#### 🔧 Implementation:

1. Search top 20 embeddings.
2. Prompt LLM to re-rank with reasoning:

```json
{
  "query": "Which users are easiest to convert?",
  "candidates": [summary1, summary2, ...]
}
```

3. Output:

```json
[
  { person_id: "abc123", score: 0.91, reason: "high cart activity" }
]
```

---

### 🧠 Step 5: Use Trait Tags (Multi-Vector, Routing)

#### 🎯 Goal:

Enable rich multi-dimensional search, like:

* product-interest
* intent level
* drop-off zone

#### 🔧 Strategy:

* Use different embedding types (behavior vs product).
* Let the LLM router choose vector source based on query intent.
* Add traits as metadata fields for filtering.

---

### 📦 Step 6: Vendor Isolation

#### 🎯 Goal:

Ensure vendors can only access their own data.

#### 🔧 Implementation:

Every query includes:

```ts
filter: { key: "vendorId", match: { value: currentVendorId } }
```

Optional: create vendor-specific collections if necessary.

---

### 📡 Step 7: Realtime Event Ingestion

#### 🎯 Goal:

Continuously reflect user behavior changes.

#### 🔧 Implementation:

* Set up a worker that listens to PostHog updates (Kafka, webhook, etc).
* On key events (cart, checkout, app open):

  * Re-summarize
  * Re-embed
  * Update Qdrant entry (using `upsert`)

Would you like us to now create the LLM router logic (e.g. classify: vector search vs db query vs combined)?
